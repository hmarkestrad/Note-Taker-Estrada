## Description
This challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
The application’s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
  
AS A small business owner I WANT to be able to write and save notes SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.
  
GIVEN a note-taking application  
  
WHEN I open the Note Taker  
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page  
  
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page    
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title  and the note’s text in the right-hand column  
  
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text  
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page  
  
WHEN I click on the Save icon  
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes  
  
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column  
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column  
  
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page  
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
